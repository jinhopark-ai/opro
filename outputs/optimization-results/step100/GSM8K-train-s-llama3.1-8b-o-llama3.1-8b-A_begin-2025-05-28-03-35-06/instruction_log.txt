Step 4, training acc: 0.0, instruction: You are welcome to use the templates in the reference models, and propose new starting sentences of your own.
Step 5, training acc: 0.0, instruction: Sentences, and see which one has the highest score. We try to make sure the score is as accurate as possible, but by design of our system, the score is not perfect. If multiple sentences tie for a highest score, we will take the one with the least number of words; that is, the sentence with the highest lexical density. In the worst case, there are multiple different sentences that have equally high scores. You just need to pick any one of the highest scoring sentences.

Methodology:
You should develop an algorithm to generate sentences based on the sentence and the score based on the style and tone of the sentence. Once you have identified your algorithm, you can experiment with different sentence and score pairs to understand the relationship between your generation and the model's score.
Step 29, training acc: 0.01532567049808429, instruction: Similarly generated starting sentences that are different from each other are acceptable and encouraged.
Step 30, training acc: 0.007662835249042145, instruction: Starting sentences which contain a " " should not receive a higher score.
Step 30, training acc: 0.0038314176245210726, instruction: The starting sentence cannot contain spaces (e.g. no " " or "," or "-").
Step 30, training acc: 0.0, instruction: It can be as broad or narrow as it would generally work.

Machine completion is accepted. This time there is no command line argument input.

NOTE: Your answer should appear closest to the test cases above. Some test cases may be partially correct. Your program should obtain a higher score than the reference solution on the test cases above to be an acceptable answer.
Step 31, training acc: 0.0, instruction: Learner, I am your teacher. I wrote the vizualization below to help the human annotators. The yellow dots in the line graph represent the options selected by annotators, and the purple triangles represent the options written in the annotations. The black triangle directly on top of the purble triangles represents the correct answer, and the magnitude implies the number of annotators picking them. Click on the black triangle for the annotation and the orange triangle for the vizualization.

Step 32, training acc: 0.0, instruction: The more the sentence is concrete and specific, the higher the score. Use a slash \ to split your answer into two parts, one in the answer box and the rest compressed into one attached file (whose extension will not change). You cannot start a line with a space, so don't indent your answer if you choose to divide your answer in two parts.

Step 38, training acc: 0.0, instruction: The goal is to generate a decoy starting sentence that captures enough of the questions' semantic content that it cannot generate valid answers for the given QA pairs. Our scoring system will capture this and generate the score.
Your generated starting sentence should not include the following:question numbers, question types, answers, answer types, problem tables, table headers, multiple choice options, numbers or letters in words.
Step 39, training acc: 0.019157088122605363, instruction: Sentence that lead to the highest line score
Step 39, training acc: 0.01532567049808429, instruction: You can generate your starting sentence using any algorithms you want and no limits on the complexity and length (it doesn’t have to be a single sentence).
Step 39, training acc: 0.0, instruction: Sentences, which will be given as input. 

Or, implement your own NLP model on top of TFX instead of fine-tuning or executing the template model.
Step 39, training acc: 0.0, instruction: If you can't express the question using a concise starting sentence, you can provide a different answer sentence format, i.e., <answer>: <N>. We will reward such a format with a bonus. If you come up with a starting sentence that is different from the test examples above, we'll also reward you and provide points for reasoning.
Step 39, training acc: 0.0, instruction: Starting sentence with the highest score in our starting sentence leaderboard. (this outperforms exercuable Questions.math)
Step 40, training acc: 0.0, instruction: The model or metric implementation you use should be fully open-source, and you should be willing to share your model or metric when prompted. Your starting sentence must contain the words "scores" and/or "%". The words "accurate", and/or "scrutiny" should not be in your starting sentence. Additional scoring rule guidelines will be available promptly.

Step 40, training acc: 0.0, instruction: The rest of the text should be rough and lets the model work on its own. Note that due date is when this predicting is completed in full.
Additional note, the comment will go away once the model is released. Also you need to command the model to resolve latent variables automatically.
Step 41, training acc: 0.0, instruction: Sentences for matching / similarities. The more similar, the lower score. Your generated starting sentence must be different than all the examples above to get any score.
The objective is to produce a good <Start> sentence by rewriting and paraphrasing the other <Start> sentences or starting anew and making it stand out so that it is different, albeit still applicable to all possible QA pairs associated with it.

Step 43, training acc: 0.0, instruction: The score should be maximized subject to the sentence being grammatical and the sentence being different from all the previous answers starting sentences. Note that we only care about the starting sentences. We are not interested in the content of each answer paragraph.
Step 43, training acc: 0.0038314176245210726, instruction: But since we do not have the answer to all the questions, your starting sentence should be self-referential and concise enough to leave room for filling in various pieces of information.
Step 43, training acc: 0.0, instruction: The starting sentence should preferably be broken into multiple sentences, and at least one sentence should involve some form of quantification(NUMBER). If you face a problem with the scoring (e.g. high score from a malformed sentence), switch to Auto generated training examples
Step 43, training acc: 0.2413793103448276, instruction: The starting sentence itself is the key point and you can ignore the input values for now.
Step 43, training acc: 0.01532567049808429, instruction: The starting sentence should not give away the answer and should not be a starter about Homosexuals having babies.
Step 44, training acc: 0.0, instruction: The supporting sentence and the ground truth answer are given after the starting sentence. The lower case and space count of the sentence are alright to differ as long as these changes do not impact the meaning.
Step 44, training acc: 0.0, instruction: Please write the starting sentence either in natural language or the NAF file that contains natural language, and paste your submission in the input box below.
Step 44, training acc: 0.0, instruction: You may generate questions that are in other forms, such as sentence pairs, as long as you return a starting sentence as your answer.

Note: The answers above are formatted individually for readability. Your model would not have this extra information.
Step 44, training acc: 0.0, instruction: Sentence. The input to the model can be any features you find interesting, such as similarity of the question to those provided above, and aspects of the solution required to answer the question. So long as you can input the features of the starting sentence into a statistical model and maximize the score in this problem, you're good.
Step 45, training acc: 0.0, instruction: Try to include whatever words can be determined from the subtraction problems above.

Your inputs are: A JSON object, a JSON object, an integer, a JSON object.
